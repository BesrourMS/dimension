# Dimension
HTML5UP Dimension Template For Pico CMS

This is Dimension, a fun little one-pager with modal-ized (is that a word?) "pages" and a cool depth effect (click on a menu item to see what I mean). Simple, fully responsive, and kitted out with all the usual pre-styled elements you'd expect.Hope you dig it :)

## Installation

Download the dimension folder and extract it to the themes folder of your Pico installation.

Update Pico CMS configuration to use dimension theme:

* Pico CMS < 2.0 
    
    Change the following setting within your config.php:

    `$config['theme'] = 'dimension';`

* Pico CMS >= 2.0
    
     Add to config/config.yml

    `theme: dimension`

    (If the file does not exist, create it. For more info see config/config.yml.template)

For the front page download our `index.md`, upload it in the content folder and make your changes.
