# Dimension
HTML5UP Dimension Template For Pico CMS

This is Dimension, a fun little one-pager with modal-ized (is that a word?) "pages" and a cool depth effect (click on a menu item to see what I mean). Simple, fully responsive, and kitted out with all the usual pre-styled elements you'd expect.Hope you dig it :)

##Installation

Download the dimension folder, extract it to the themes folder of your Pico installation, and change the following setting within your config.php:

`$config['theme'] = 'dimension';`

For the content download our `index.md`, upload it in the content folder and make your changes.
