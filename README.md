# Dimension

[HTML5 UP Dimension](https://html5up.net/dimension) Template For Pico CMS

This is Dimension, a fun little one-pager with modal "pages" and a cool depth effect (click on a menu item to see what I mean). Simple, fully responsive, and kitted out with all the usual pre-styled elements you'd expect. Hope you dig it. :)

## Installation

1) Download the `dimension` folder and extract it to the `themes` folder of your Pico installation.

2) Set your theme to `dimension` in Pico's config file:
    - **For Pico 2.0+**: Set `theme: dimension` in `config.yml`.
    - **For older versions of Pico**: Set `$config['theme'] = 'dimension';` in `config.php`.

3) Configure your front page using `index.md`.  You can download our `content-sample/index.md`, to use as a template, or just create your own.  See [`content-sample/index.md`](https://github.com/BesrourMS/dimension/blob/master/content-sample/index.md?plain=1) for more information.

### Upgrading Note

Older versions of Dimension required you to set `Template: single` in your markdown files.  This is no longer required.

If you're upgrading Dimension, however, you'll have to **remove that line from your markdown** or you'll see an "Unable to find template" error when visiting those pages individually.
